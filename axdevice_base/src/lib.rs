//! This crate provides basic traits and structures for emulated devices of ArceOS hypervisor.
//!
//! This crate contains:
//! - [`BaseDeviceOps`] trait: The trait that all emulated devices must implement.
//! - [`EmuDeviceType`] enum: Enumeration representing the type of emulator devices.
//!   (Already moved to `axvmconfig` crate.)
